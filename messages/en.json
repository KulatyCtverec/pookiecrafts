    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Find answers to common questions about our products",
    "q1": "How long do the candles burn?",
    "a1": "Our candles provide approximately 40-50 hours of burn time, depending on the size. To maximize burn time, always trim the wick to 1/4 inch before lighting and allow the wax to melt to the edge of the container on the first burn.",
    "q2": "What are the candles made from?",
    "a2": "All our candles are hand-poured using 100% natural soy wax, premium fragrance oils, and cotton wicks. We use eco-friendly, sustainable ingredients that are vegan and cruelty-free.",
    "q3": "What paper do you use for notebooks?",
    "a3": "Our notebooks feature high-quality, acid-free paper (120gsm) that prevents bleed-through and yellowing over time. Each notebook contains 120 pages of smooth writing paper.",
    "q4": "Do you offer international shipping?",
    "a4": "Currently, we ship within the US only. We offer free shipping on orders over $50. Most orders ship within 1-2 business days and arrive within 3-5 business days.",
